Hi FSR,

This directory has the code working for just one tagged region but not
multiple tags. I'm leaving you to fix the multiple tagged region
code. Follow what I did here and you should be able to extrapolate to
fix the multiple tag code. 

I removed the code that I had in history.F90 to write the tagmask to
the history file. his didn't matter. Keep it if you like. It never
worked perfectly anyway. If you decide to get rid of it, be sure to
keep the history.F90 modification to the table length. If you get rid
of it, you need to also get rid of code changes in diagnsotics.F90
(you can stop compiling a file in your SourceMods directory by
gzipping it).

Previously I had masked the tagged isotope surface fluxes in 3
separate routines for ocean (srfoce.F90), ice (ice_srf.F90) and land
(wtrc_land.F90). Look at the code that I had in those files by
searching "TAGGING". I took them out the code by first commenting and
then finally just gzipping the whole file. I moved the tag masking
code into physpkg.F90 where it masks the surface fluxes for all
surface types at once. Look at the code there by searching
TAGGING. Compare it to the code in the the three land types to see the
major difference.

Before I had:
  tagged surface flux = mask * tagged surface flux

But now I have
  tagged surface flux = mask * total surface flux

Think about why this was a bug.

I suggest you try to modify the multiple tag code in the same fashion
by moving the masking code into physpkg.F90 and gzipping the three
component files. You shouldn't have to alter water_tracer.F90 at
all. cYou only need to run the code for one month to check if the
surface fluxes are exactly the same.
