PROBLEMS

  QNEG triggers for HDO and HTO after vertical diffusion ???


VERSION LOG 

cam3_0_iso0_20 David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Tue May 17 18:03:13 MDT 2005
        Impliments CLM isotope scheme for water - no fractionation.

cam3_0_iso0_19  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Sat Dec  4 12:21:09 MST 2004
        Output tracer advectieve and total tendencies (on master list).

cam3_0_iso0_18  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Wed Oct 20 13:38:53 MDT 2004
        Base tuning selcted for HDO and H218O. Added (optional) output for historgrams
        of vapour and total water isotopic composition (untested for long run).

cam3_0_iso0_17  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Wed Sep 15 11:06:25 MDT 2004
        Tuning fiddles - fiddles with O17 and HTO fractionation (which are still wrong)

cam3_0_iso0_16  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Wed Sep  8 16:26:12 MDT 2004
        Schemes "fsnk" uniformly in the three condensation routines
        (calls to dicm). All tunables now in external routine (wtrc_camtune)

cam3_O_iso0_15  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Fri Aug 13 12:08:05 MDT 2004
        (Reimplimentation of 0_14 changes)
        NEEDS exponential form for feq in dicm.
        NEEDS downdraft.	( <-- What did I mean by this? )
        All fractionation now done as external calls to water_isotope module 
        (changes to zm evap, zm downdrafts and cloud liquid)

cam3_0_iso0_14  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Fri Aug  6 17:13:59 MDT 2004
        Reimplimented fractionation for H217O and HTO (now based on H218O and HDO)
        Reimplimented methane oxidation source for HDO, based on McCarthy, with
        additional effects for oxygen state.
        Now allow some tunable fraction of cloud ice to equilibrate.
        Reimplimented fractionation to properly account for partial equilibration.

cam3_0_iso0_13  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Tue Aug  3 11:18:13 MDT 2004
        Allow precipitation formation from mixed cloud in large scale condensation, 
        mixes with cloud below, then uses partial removal. 
        Bug fixes for kinetic effects. 
        Now use full "kmol" calulation based on computer ustar.
        Changed diffusivities to "cappa" (kinetics theory) numbers.
        Fixed fractionation factors for H217O and HTO - also turned on.
        (bug fix in tritium decay)

cam3_0_iso0_12  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Fri Jul 30 11:45:32 MDT 2004
        Support for finte volume core.
        Minor bug fix "tcld" and "fice" in moist convection.
        "Feature fix" for wtrc_check to do only ncol, rather than pcols.
        (also changes Rstd back to 1)

cam3_0_iso0_11  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Tue Jul 27 11:34:45 MDT 2004
	CAM MOD - allow convective schemes to decide on "ice/liquid" and "rain/snow"
        these are now passed to zm_detrain, and zm_evap independently.
        Inputs to energy checks modified in tphys to accomodate this
        Minor fixes for restart/initial history files.

cam3_0_iso0_10  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Sun Jul 25 20:19:15 MDT 2004
        CMF and ZMC plume temperature as in updrafts/downdrafts.
        ZMC dicm explictly accounts for entrainment and detrainment - 
         which simplifies the code.
        (wtrc_land water scheme fixed.)

cam3_0_iso0_9  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Wed Jul 21 15:25:52 MDT 2004
        Changed fractionation scheme for nonentraining, iterative multi-phase isotope
        model in cldcond, cmfmca and zmc_conv.
        Removed various debugging stops.
        limit qu > 0 and ql > 0, and compute cu from qu budget in cldprp.

cam3_0_iso0_8  David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Tue Jul 20 13:30:58 MDT 2004
        Reformulated tracer ZM scheme to work with fluxes (thus conserving mass!)
        Added traps in ZM code to limit problems occuring with qu < 0 
          (note possible fix - use simple mean rather than log. interp in cldprp, 
           another option is to redifine convective top where hu-h* is strange)
          (also, this needs a correction for water tracer tendencies)
          (notice too, that some of the conservation comes from cam3 increasing 
           qmin to 1.e-12 (from 1.e-18) for Q)
        Limited ZM downdrafts to ensure pflx > 0, always. 
        Added perfect restart IO
        Added tracer outpout to "initial" history file.
        Added simple land scheme, not tested, not used for tracers (diagnostic only)

cam3_0_iso0_7   David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Tue Jul 13 11:35:07 MDT 2004
        Added diagnostic tests for H2O (v, l and i) must match prognostic.
        Added sea ice scheme. Simple land scheme (assign smow).
        Define all as "wet" tracers, with mod in dp_coupling for treating
        vapour phase explicitly as dry (even though it's defined as wet like Q)
        [This means vertical diffusion is done correctly wet]
         
cam3_0_iso0_6   David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Mon Jul 12 16:33:51 MDT 2004
        ZM convection tracers from CCM3, with reevap and detraining liquid.
        T5 and T31 tests "OK" but problems....time for serious debugging.

cam3_0_iso0_5   David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Mon Jul 12 11:00:08 MDT 2004
        Puts detrained cloud from Hack into cloud liquid.
        Does reevaporation for falling Hack precip.
        Transports tracer liquid and ice due to convection.

cam3_0_iso0_4   David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Mon Jul  5 11:36:34 MDT 2004
	"Hack" moist convetcive adjustmeny.

cam3_0_iso0_3   David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Sat Jul  3 11:07:54 MDT 2004
        Cloud water budget with precipitation production.
        (Isotope scheme needs some reworking - may be mass imbalance for ice and liquid)

cam3_0_iso0_2	David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Fri Jul  2 15:08:14 MDT 2004
        BUGFIX: qbot correctly passed for srfxfer
        Archived fluxes up and down only for vapour phase (total for all phases)
        Archive tracer precipitation (vapour index) to history file
        dadadj now adjusts all tracers
        isotopic equilibrium between cloud ice and vapour (wtrc_cldliq_equilibrate)
        non-fractionating sedimentation flux

cam3_0_iso0_1	David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Thu Jul  1 20:04:07 MDT 2004
        Ocean sources with fractionation, so vapour state equilibrates.
        Archive surface fluxes up and down.

cam3_0_iso0_0	David Noone <dcn@colorado.edu> - Thu Jul  1 20:03:56 MDT 2004
	tracer infrastructure
